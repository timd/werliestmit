An interactive map showing where Swiss municipalities host their email — whether with US hyperscalers (Microsoft, Google, AWS) or Swiss providers or other solutions.

## How it works

The data pipeline has three steps:

1. **Preprocess** -- Fetches all ~2100 Swiss municipalities from Wikidata, performs MX and SPF DNS lookups on their official domains, and classifies each municipality's email provider.
2. **Postprocess** -- Applies manual overrides for edge cases, retries DNS for unresolved domains, then scrapes websites of still-unclassified municipalities for email addresses.
3. **Validate** -- Cross-validates MX and SPF records, assigns a confidence score (0-100) to each entry, and generates a validation report.

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync

uv run preprocess
uv run postprocess
uv run validate

# Serve the map locally
python -m http.server
```

## Development

```bash
uv sync --group dev

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing

# Lint the codebase
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run ruff format src tests
```

## Contributing

If you spot a misclassification, please open an issue with the BFS number and the correct provider.
For municipalities where automated detection fails, corrections can be added to the `MANUAL_OVERRIDES` dict in `src/mail_sovereignty/postprocess.py`.
